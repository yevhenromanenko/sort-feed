## Notes

- ⚠️ The extension **does not intercept or modify** LinkedIn API requests
- 📊 Data is collected only for **analytical purposes**
- 💾 All data is stored **locally in the browser** (chrome.storage.local)
- 🔒 The extension does not send data to external servers
- 📝 Maximum 1000 posts are stored simultaneously (old ones are removed)
- 🔄 Posts are cleared on page refresh to show only current session data

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not collecting data

1. Make sure you are on the `https://www.linkedin.com/feed` page
2. Check the browser console (F12) for errors
3. Reload the LinkedIn page
4. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

### Posts not displaying

1. Make sure you have scrolled through the feed on LinkedIn (the extension collects data when new posts load)
2. Check that the extension is active (icon should be visible)
3. Try clearing data and starting over
